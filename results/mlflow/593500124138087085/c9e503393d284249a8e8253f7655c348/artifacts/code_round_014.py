The performance history shows a strong trend towards using `GATConv` as the initial layer, often with `128` output channels and `leaky_relu` activation. The subsequent layer is typically a `GCNConv` with `64` output channels and either `relu` or `prelu`. The final layer is consistently `GCNConv` with `"auto"` output channels and `identity` activation.

The best performing architectures use `prelu` or `leaky_relu` in the first layer and `prelu` or `relu` in the second. Dropout values of 0.5 and 0.6, and learning rates of 0.01 and 0.005 seem to be effective. Epochs of 200 have also yielded better results than 100.

Given the exploitation phase and the strong performance of `GATConv` followed by `GCNConv`, I will slightly modify the best performing architecture:

- Keep the first layer as `GATConv` with `128` `out_channels`.
- Experiment with `relu` as the activation for the first layer, as `leaky_relu` has been explored extensively in top performers.
- Keep the second layer as `GCNConv` with `64` `out_channels`.
- Change the activation of the second layer to `leaky_relu`, as the top performers used `relu` or `prelu`. This is a small perturbation.
- Keep the final `GCNConv` with `"auto"` output channels and `identity` activation.
- For hyperparameters, I will select `epochs: 200`, `lr: 0.005`, and `dropout: 0.5` which are common in the better performing models.
