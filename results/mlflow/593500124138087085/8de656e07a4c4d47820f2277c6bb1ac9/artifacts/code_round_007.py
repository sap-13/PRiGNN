As a world-class expert in GNNs and AutoML, I will analyze the provided task context, search space, and performance history to propose a new, state-of-the-art GNN architecture. My strategy will be driven by the "Exploitation" phase in round 7 of 20, focusing on refining promising past architectures with incremental improvements.

**Analysis of Performance History:**

*   **Dominant Layer Types:** GATConv and SAGEConv appear consistently in the top-performing architectures. GCNConv is also present, often as the final layer with an `identity` activation.
*   **Output Channels:** 128 `out_channels` for GATConv and 64 or 128 for SAGEConv seem to yield good results.
*   **Activations:** `prelu` and `relu` are frequent in hidden layers. `identity` is consistently used for the final layer.
*   **Overall Success:** The best performance (0.7560) comes from `GATConv(128, prelu)` -> `SAGEConv(64, relu)` -> `GCNConv(auto, identity)`. This suggests a strong combination of GAT and SAGE, with GAT potentially capturing more complex relationships due to its attention mechanism, followed by SAGE for feature propagation and a final GCN for aggregation.

**Strategic Improvements for Round 7 (Exploitation):**

Given the success of the `GATConv` -> `SAGEConv` -> `GCNConv` pattern, I will build upon this. The top architecture used 128 channels for GAT and 64 for SAGE.

1.  **Refine Layer Combination and Order:** The best performing architecture used `GATConv` then `SAGEConv`. I'll stick with this order, but consider minor variations in channel sizes or activation for the intermediate layers.
2.  **Explore Higher Capacity for GAT:** The best architecture used `GATConv` with 128 channels. I will maintain this or explore slightly higher values if the search space allowed, but it doesn't. So, 128 is a good choice.
3.  **Explore Intermediate SAGEConv Variations:** The best architecture used `SAGEConv` with 64 channels. I will try to slightly increase this to 128 for the intermediate SAGEConv layer, as 128 `out_channels` for SAGEConv also performed reasonably well in another instance.
4.  **Final Layer:** Continue using `GCNConv` with `identity` activation as the final classification layer.
5.  **Hyperparameters:**
    *   **Dropout:** The best performing architecture did not explicitly specify dropout, but it is a common hyperparameter. Based on the available options, 0.5 or 0.6 are reasonable starting points. I will lean towards 0.6 to potentially regularize more effectively, given the task's complexity.
    *   **Epochs:** The best performing architecture might have implicitly used a certain number of epochs. Since 200 epochs are available and the task might require longer training, 200 is a good choice for further exploitation.
    *   **Learning Rate:** The best performing architecture's LR is not specified. Given the options, 0.005 has appeared in successful configurations. I will select 0.005.

**Proposed Architecture:**

Based on this analysis and strategy, I propose the following architecture:

*   **Layer 1:** `GATConv` with 128 `out_channels` and `prelu` activation (as it performed best in the top architecture).
*   **Layer 2:** `SAGEConv` with 128 `out_channels` and `relu` activation (slightly increasing from the best performer's 64 to explore higher capacity for SAGE).
*   **Layer 3:** `GCNConv` with `auto` `out_channels` and `identity` activation (consistent with successful patterns).

**Hyperparameters:**

*   `epochs`: 200
*   `lr`: 0.005
*   `dropout`: 0.6

This design aims to build upon the strong performance of GAT followed by SAGE, slightly increasing the capacity of the SAGE layer and retaining the proven final GCN layer. The hyperparameters are chosen to promote further refinement.
