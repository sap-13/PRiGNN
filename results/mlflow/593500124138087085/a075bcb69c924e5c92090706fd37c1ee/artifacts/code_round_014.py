Analyzing the performance history, we see a trend where architectures with a combination of `SAGEConv` and `GATConv` (or vice versa) in the first two layers, followed by `GCNConv` as the final layer, tend to perform well. The best performing architectures use `prelu` or `relu` activations. The `out_channels` of 64 and 128 have been more successful than 32 for the initial layers. The output layer consistently uses `GCNConv` with `identity` activation.

Given we are in the exploitation phase, we should make incremental improvements around the successful patterns. The best score of 0.7720 was achieved with `SAGEConv(64, prelu)` -> `GATConv(32, relu)` -> `GCNConv(auto, identity)`. Another good performer was `GCNConv(128, relu)` -> `GATConv(64, leaky_relu)` -> `GCNConv(auto, identity)`.

Let's try to combine elements from these successful architectures. We'll stick with a two-layer feature extraction followed by a final projection layer. We'll prioritize `SAGEConv` and `GATConv` in the first two layers, experimenting with activations and channel sizes that have performed well.

Considering the best performing architecture:
- `SAGEConv` with `prelu` and 64 channels was the first layer.
- `GATConv` with `relu` and 32 channels was the second layer.

Let's try increasing the channels of the `GATConv` layer slightly, as `128` channels in the first layer of other architectures also performed reasonably well. We will also try `relu` for the first layer, which has also shown good results.

Therefore, a promising candidate would be:
- First layer: `SAGEConv` with `relu` activation and 128 output channels. This leverages a strong first layer from previous attempts.
- Second layer: `GATConv` with `relu` activation and 64 output channels. This is a good intermediate number of channels and a common activation.
- Third layer: `GCNConv` with `identity` activation and `auto` output channels, which is a consistent pattern for the final layer.

For hyperparameters, `epochs: 200` and `lr: 0.005` have been used in good performing models, and `dropout: 0.6` also appeared in one of the better models.
