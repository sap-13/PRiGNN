The performance history indicates that architectures featuring `GATConv` in the initial layers, often with `128` or `64` output channels and `leaky_relu` or `prelu` activation, tend to perform well. The presence of `SAGEConv` as the second layer also seems beneficial, and `GCNConv` as the final layer with `auto` output channels is a consistent pattern.

The best performing architectures have achieved around 0.7560. The current round is 17 out of 20, and we are in the exploitation phase, so we should aim to slightly improve upon the best performing architectures.

Let's consider the top performing architecture:
`{"layers": [{"layer_type": "GATConv", "out_channels": 128, "activation": "leaky_relu"}, {"layer_type": "SAGEConv", "out_channels": 64, "activation": "prelu"}, {"layer_type": "GCNConv", "out_channels": "auto", "activation": "identity"}]}`

We can try a slight variation:
1. **Initial Layer:** Keep `GATConv` with `128` channels and `leaky_relu` as it has shown good results.
2. **Second Layer:** Stick with `SAGEConv` and `prelu` as it also appears to be a strong combination. Let's try varying the `out_channels` slightly, perhaps to `128` to see if a wider representation helps.
3. **Final Layer:** Keep `GCNConv` with `auto` output channels and `identity` activation, as this seems to be a robust choice.

For hyperparameters, the `epochs` of 200 and `lr` of 0.005 are present in some of the better performing runs. `dropout` of 0.5 or 0.6 seem to be common. Let's try a slightly higher `dropout` to potentially improve regularization.

Considering these points, a promising architecture would be:
