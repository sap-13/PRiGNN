The performance history shows that architectures with a combination of `SAGEConv` and `GATConv` in the initial layers tend to perform well, especially when followed by a `GCNConv` with `identity` activation. The top-performing models utilize `prelu` or `relu` as activations in the first layers and channel counts like 64 or 128. The highest validation metric (0.7720) was achieved with `SAGEConv(64, prelu) -> GATConv(32, relu) -> GCNConv(auto, identity)`.

Given the exploitation phase and the desire for incremental improvement, let's build upon this successful pattern. We can try increasing the `out_channels` of the `GATConv` layer slightly or experiment with a different activation for the first layer. Since `prelu` showed good results, we can stick with that. For the second layer, `relu` performed well, and the best model used a smaller channel count (32). Let's try keeping it at 32 but ensure the first layer has a decent number of channels.

Considering the best performing architecture: `SAGEConv(64, prelu) -> GATConv(32, relu) -> GCNConv(auto, identity)`.
We can try to boost the representational capacity of the first layer. Let's increase the `out_channels` of `SAGEConv` to 128. For the second layer, let's keep `GATConv` and `relu` but perhaps increase its `out_channels` slightly as well, or try a different activation. Given the constraint of incremental improvement and the success of the top model, let's stick with the first layer as `SAGEConv` with `prelu` and a higher channel count, and then try a different GNN layer for the second stage before the final `GCNConv`.

Let's propose an architecture that starts with `SAGEConv` with `prelu` and `128` channels, followed by `GATConv` with `relu` and `64` channels, and finally `GCNConv` with `identity`. This increases the capacity in the first layer and uses a combination that has previously shown promise. We will also choose hyperparameters that have been associated with good performance, like `epochs: 200`, `lr: 0.005`, and `dropout: 0.6`.
