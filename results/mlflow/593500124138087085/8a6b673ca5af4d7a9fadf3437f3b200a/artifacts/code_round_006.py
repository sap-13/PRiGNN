The performance history shows a trend towards using GATConv and SAGEConv, especially in the earlier layers, and a preference for `leaky_relu` and `prelu` activations. The best performing architectures have 64 or 128 channels in the first layer. The last layer consistently uses `"auto"` channels and `identity` activation. The dropout of 0.6 and learning rate of 0.005 seem to perform well.

Given we are in the exploitation phase and round 6 of 20, we should refine the successful patterns. The top performing model used `GCNConv` (64, `prelu`), `GATConv` (32, `leaky_relu`), `SAGEConv` (`auto`, `identity`). This suggests a mix of layer types and a decreasing channel size in the middle layer might be beneficial.

Let's try to build upon the best performing architecture. We can try increasing the channels in the first layer and perhaps experiment with a different ordering of GATConv and SAGEConv, while keeping the general pattern of a final "auto" layer.

Considering the best performance of 0.7460:
- `GCNConv(64, prelu)` -> `GATConv(32, leaky_relu)` -> `SAGEConv(auto, identity)`

Let's try a similar structure but potentially increase the capacity or slightly tweak the activations/layer types based on the general success of GAT and SAGE. We will stick with `leaky_relu` and `prelu` as they appear to be beneficial. The best performance used `leaky_relu` in the second layer.

New proposal:
- First layer: `GATConv` (common in good performers, let's try 128 channels for more capacity) with `leaky_relu`.
- Second layer: `SAGEConv` (also common in good performers) with `prelu` and 64 channels.
- Third layer: `GCNConv` (as a final layer) with `auto` channels and `identity` activation.

Hyperparameters:
- Epochs: Let's stick with 200 as it's the higher value tried.
- LR: 0.005 seems to be a good choice.
- Dropout: 0.6 is also a good choice.
