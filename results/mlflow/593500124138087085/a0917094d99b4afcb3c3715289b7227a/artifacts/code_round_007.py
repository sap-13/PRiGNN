In this round (7 of 20), we are in the exploitation phase. The best performing architectures in the history generally utilize a combination of GCNConv, GATConv, and SAGEConv, with "relu" or "leaky_relu" activations in the earlier layers and "identity" in the final layer. The `out_channels` of 64 and 128 appear to be good choices for the initial layers. The historical data also suggests that SAGEConv and GATConv are strong contenders for the first layer, followed by another GNN layer.

The top-performing models have achieved around 0.77. The highest score was 0.7720 with `SAGEConv` (prelu, 64 channels) -> `GATConv` (relu, 32 channels) -> `GCNConv` (identity, auto channels).

Given this, I will try to refine the top-performing architecture by slightly modifying it. I'll keep the overall structure but experiment with a different activation for the first layer, potentially exploring `relu` for SAGEConv, and consider a slightly higher `out_channels` for the second layer based on the general trend of deeper/wider layers performing well. I will also tune hyperparameters like `lr` and `dropout` based on the successful past trials.

Specifically, I will try:
- **Layer 1:** `SAGEConv` with `relu` activation and `128` out_channels. This is a slight increase in complexity from the best performing `prelu` and 64 channels.
- **Layer 2:** `GATConv` with `relu` activation and `64` out_channels. This is a slight increase in channels from the best performing 32 channels, which might offer more capacity.
- **Layer 3:** `GCNConv` with `identity` activation and `auto` out_channels, keeping this consistent.
- **Hyperparameters:** Keep `epochs` at 200 and `dropout` at 0.6 as these were used in some good performing models. For `lr`, I'll try 0.005, as it was present in a good performing configuration.
