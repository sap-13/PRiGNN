Analyzing the performance history, architectures with `GATConv` and `SAGEConv` in the initial layers seem to perform well. Specifically, `GATConv` with 64 `out_channels` and `leaky_relu` activation has appeared in multiple high-performing models. The best performing model used `GCNConv` as the final layer with `auto` output channels and `identity` activation.

Considering the "Exploitation" phase, I will try to build upon the successful pattern of using `GATConv` followed by `SAGEConv` or `GCNConv` in the first two layers. I'll stick with `GATConv` with 64 channels and `leaky_relu` as it's a strong performer. For the second layer, `SAGEConv` with 128 channels and `prelu` activation has also shown good results. For the final layer, `GCNConv` with `auto` channels and `identity` activation is a consistent choice.

For hyperparameters, the best performing model had a validation metric of 0.7460 and used `prelu` activation, `GATConv` (32 channels), `leaky_relu` activation, `SAGEConv` (auto channels), and `identity` activation. The best learning rates seem to be around 0.01 and 0.005. Dropout of 0.5 or 0.6 is also seen. I'll try a combination of these.
