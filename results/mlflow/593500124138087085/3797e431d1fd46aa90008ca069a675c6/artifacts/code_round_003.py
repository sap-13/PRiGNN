The previous architectures explored a combination of SAGEConv, GATConv, and GCNConv, with varying `out_channels` and `activation` functions. The best performing architecture had `SAGEConv` (64 channels, prelu), `GATConv` (32 channels, relu), and `GCNConv` (auto, identity).

Given that we are in the exploration phase and round 3 of 20, it's beneficial to try a different combination of layer types and explore a different aspect of the search space. The previous best had a `prelu` activation in the first layer. Let's try `leaky_relu` for the first layer with a `GATConv`, as GAT is known to benefit from non-linear activations. We can then follow this with a `SAGEConv` and a final `GCNConv`. Let's also increase the `out_channels` in the first layer to 128 to see if more capacity helps. For hyperparameters, let's explore a different `lr` and `dropout` combination.
