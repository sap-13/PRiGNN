The performance history indicates that GATConv and SAGEConv layers are generally performing better than GCNConv in the initial layers. Specifically, architectures with `GATConv` in the first layer and a combination of `GATConv`, `SAGEConv`, and `GCNConv` in subsequent layers show good results. `leaky_relu` and `prelu` activations are also prevalent in the top-performing models. The `out_channels` of 64 and 128 seem to be good starting points for the initial layers, with `"auto"` for the last layer. The best performance achieved so far is 0.7460.

Given the "Exploitation" phase and the goal of incremental improvement, I will build upon the successful patterns observed. The top-performing architecture used `GCNConv`, `GATConv`, and `SAGEConv` with `prelu` and `leaky_relu` activations. I will try to combine these elements in a way that might offer a slight improvement.

Considering the best result: `{"layers": [{"layer_type": "GCNConv", "out_channels": 64, "activation": "prelu"}, {"layer_type": "GATConv", "out_channels": 32, "activation": "leaky_relu"}, {"layer_type": "SAGEConv", "out_channels": "auto", "activation": "identity"}]}` with a validation metric of 0.7460.

Let's try a slight variation. Starting with `GATConv` which has shown good results in other high-performing architectures, with `leaky_relu` activation and `128` out_channels. For the second layer, let's use `SAGEConv` with `prelu` activation and `64` out_channels. The final layer will be `GCNConv` with `"auto"` out_channels and `identity` activation.

For hyperparameters, the best results have used `epochs` of 200 and `dropout` of 0.6. The `lr` values have been varied, with 0.001 and 0.005 performing reasonably well. I will try `lr: 0.005` again, as it was used in some of the better performing models.
