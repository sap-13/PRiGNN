The previous architectures show some promise, with the best performing one using `SAGEConv` followed by `GATConv` and then `GCNConv` with `prelu` and `relu` activations. The `out_channels` of 64 for the first layer and 32 for the second layer seemed to work well. The final `GCNConv` with `auto` output channels is a standard practice for the output layer. The dropout of 0.5 and learning rate of 0.01 also achieved a decent score.

Given that we are in the exploration phase and it's only round 4 of 20, it's good to explore different combinations of layers and hyperparameters. We can try increasing the number of units in the first layer and explore a different activation for the first layer. Also, let's experiment with a different dropout and learning rate.

Here's a strategy:
1.  **Layer 1:** Let's try `GCNConv` with `relu` and a higher `out_channels` of 128 to explore a wider receptive field early on.
2.  **Layer 2:** Following the success of `GATConv` in previous attempts, let's use `GATConv` with `leaky_relu` and 64 `out_channels`. This introduces attention mechanisms and a different activation.
3.  **Layer 3:** Keep the `GCNConv` with `identity` activation and `auto` output channels for the final classification layer, as it has performed consistently.
4.  **Hyperparameters:** Let's try a lower learning rate of `0.005` and a higher dropout of `0.6` to see if it improves generalization. We will stick with `100` epochs for now to allow for more diverse architectural exploration in early rounds.
