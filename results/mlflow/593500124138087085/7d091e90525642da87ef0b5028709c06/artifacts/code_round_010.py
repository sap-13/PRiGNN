The performance history shows that `GATConv` and `SAGEConv` have performed well, especially when combined. The best performing architecture (`0.7560`) used `GATConv` (128 channels, leaky_relu), followed by `SAGEConv` (64 channels, prelu), and then `GCNConv` (auto, identity). This suggests that a deeper or more complex initial layer like `GATConv` with higher `out_channels` and a non-linear activation like `leaky_relu` or `prelu` is beneficial. The final `GCNConv` with `identity` activation is common across good performers, acting as a simple aggregator.

Considering the "Exploitation" phase and round 10, we should build upon the successful patterns. The top performer had `GATConv` with 128 channels. Let's explore a similar setup but perhaps try a different activation or slightly adjust the subsequent layers. Given the good performance of `prelu` in the second layer of the best model, let's try `prelu` for the initial `GATConv` layer. We'll keep the `out_channels` at 128 for the first layer and consider a reasonable number for the second. The second best architectures often used a mix of `GATConv` and `SAGEConv` with 32 or 64 channels. Let's try 64 channels for the second layer. We'll keep the final `GCNConv` with `identity`.

For hyperparameters, the best performance came from `epochs`: 200 and `lr`: 0.005 or 0.01. Dropout of 0.5 or 0.6 have also been seen. Let's slightly nudge the hyperparameters based on the top performer. We'll stick with 200 epochs and try a learning rate of 0.005, and a dropout of 0.5 to see if it can improve.
