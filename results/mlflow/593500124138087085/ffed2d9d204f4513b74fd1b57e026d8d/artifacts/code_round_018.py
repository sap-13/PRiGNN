The performance history indicates that architectures with `SAGEConv` and `GATConv` in the initial layers, followed by `GCNConv` with `out_channels: auto` and `activation: identity`, tend to perform well. The best performing architectures utilize 64 or 128 `out_channels` for the initial layers and `relu` or `prelu` as activations.

Given the current round (18/20) and the exploitation phase, I will focus on refining the successful patterns. I will try a combination of `SAGEConv` with `prelu` and a slightly higher `out_channels` (128) for the first layer, followed by `GATConv` with `relu` and 64 `out_channels`. The final layer will remain `GCNConv` with `auto` and `identity`. For hyperparameters, I will experiment with a higher dropout of 0.6 and a learning rate of 0.005, as these have been present in some of the better performing models.
