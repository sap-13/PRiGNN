The performance history indicates that `GATConv` layers, particularly with higher `out_channels` (128), and `prelu` activation in the initial layers have performed well. The best performing architecture used `GATConv` (128 channels, prelu) followed by `SAGEConv` (64 channels, relu) and `GCNConv` (auto, identity).

Given the **Exploitation** phase and being in round 6, the strategy should be to refine these successful patterns with minor adjustments.

**Reasoning for the proposed architecture:**

*   **First Layer:** Continue with `GATConv` as it has shown strong performance. Keep `out_channels` at 128 and `activation` as `prelu` to leverage the best performing components.
*   **Second Layer:** The top-performing model used `SAGEConv` with `relu` activation and 64 channels. Let's try increasing the `out_channels` to 128 for the `SAGEConv` layer, as a slightly higher channel count might provide more capacity while still being in the spirit of exploitation. Keep `relu` activation.
*   **Third Layer:** The final layer consistently uses `GCNConv` with `identity` activation and `auto` out_channels. This pattern has proven effective for the final projection.
*   **Hyperparameters:**
    *   **Epochs:** The top models used 100 or 200 epochs. Let's stick with 200 to ensure thorough convergence.
    *   **Learning Rate:** 0.005 and 0.01 have been used. 0.005 yielded a better result previously. Let's keep 0.005.
    *   **Dropout:** 0.5 and 0.6 have been explored. 0.5 was present in the best model. Let's try 0.5.

This design aims to build upon the best performing architecture by slightly increasing the capacity of the second layer, staying within the successful component types and activations, and using hyperparameters that have previously led to good results.
