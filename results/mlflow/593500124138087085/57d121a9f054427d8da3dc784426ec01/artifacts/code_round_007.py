The previous best performance was 0.7460 with an architecture that used `GCNConv` (64 channels, prelu), `GATConv` (32 channels, leaky_relu), and `SAGEConv` (auto channels, identity). This suggests a preference for a mix of convolutional layers and a specific activation pattern.

Given we are in the exploitation phase and round 7, we should try to build upon this success.
- The previous best had `GCNConv` first, followed by `GATConv`. Let's try swapping them to see if that yields improvements.
- The `out_channels` of the first two layers were 64 and 32. Let's stick with these values.
- `prelu` and `leaky_relu` were used in the first two layers. Let's try `leaky_relu` for the first and `prelu` for the second.
- The last layer remains `SAGEConv` with `identity` activation and `auto` channels, which seems to be a consistent successful pattern.
- Hyperparameters: The best performance came from epochs 200 and lr 0.005, dropout 0.6. These hyperparameters achieved the best validation metric. Let's try to maintain these successful hyperparameters.

Based on this analysis, here's the proposed architecture:
