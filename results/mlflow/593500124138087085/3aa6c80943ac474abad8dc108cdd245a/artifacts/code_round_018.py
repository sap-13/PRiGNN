The performance history shows that `GATConv` with `128` `out_channels` and `prelu` activation for the first layer consistently performs well, achieving the highest validation metric of `0.7560`. The second layer seems to benefit from `SAGEConv` with `64` `out_channels` and `relu` activation. The final layer is generally `GCNConv` with `identity` activation and `auto` `out_channels`.

Given the exploitation phase, the strategy is to make incremental improvements around successful patterns. We will stick with the successful `GATConv` and `SAGEConv` combination. To potentially improve the best performing architecture (0.7560), we can consider slight variations:

*   **Activation for the second layer:** The best model used `relu` for the second `SAGEConv`. Let's try `prelu` again, as it has also performed well in conjunction with other layers.
*   **Hyperparameters:** The best performing model did not specify hyperparameters, but previous good performers often used `epochs: 200`, `lr: 0.005`, and `dropout: 0.6`. We will incorporate these to see if they further boost performance.
