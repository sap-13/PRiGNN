The Cora dataset is well-studied, and GATConv and SAGEConv generally perform well on it. The best performing architectures in the history used a combination of GATConv and SAGEConv, often with GATConv as the first layer. The `out_channels` for the first layers are either 64 or 128. The `activation` functions have varied, but `leaky_relu` and `prelu` have appeared in the top-performing models. The final layer consistently uses `GCNConv` with an `identity` activation and `out_channels` set to "auto".

Considering the exploration phase and the performance history, I will propose an architecture that combines different layers and hyperparameter settings. I will lean towards using `GATConv` first, with a higher number of `out_channels` and a `leaky_relu` activation, as it showed promise. For the second layer, I'll try `SAGEConv` with `prelu` to introduce some variation. The final layer will remain `GCNConv` with `identity` activation. For hyperparameters, I will explore a slightly different `lr` and `dropout` combination that hasn't been heavily tested.
