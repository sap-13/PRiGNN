As a world-class expert in GNNs and AutoML, and being in round 10 of 20 with an "Exploitation" phase strategy, my focus is on refining successful patterns from the performance history.

Observing the past performance:
- The top-performing architectures all use a 3-layer structure.
- The first layer consistently uses `GATConv` with `out_channels` of 128 and a non-identity activation (`prelu` and `leaky_relu`). `relu` also performed well.
- The second layer seems to benefit from either `GCNConv` or `SAGEConv` with `out_channels` of 64 and a `relu` activation.
- The final layer is always `GCNConv` with `out_channels: "auto"` and `activation: "identity"`.
- The best validation metric of 0.7620 was achieved with `GCNConv` (64, `prelu`) -> `GATConv` (128, `relu`) -> `GCNConv` (`auto`, `identity`).

Considering the "Exploitation" strategy, I will build upon the best-performing architecture by making minor adjustments. The combination of `GCNConv` and `GATConv` seems to be a strong pattern. The previous best used `prelu` for the first layer and `relu` for the second. Let's try switching the activations slightly to see if we can further optimize. `leaky_relu` has also shown good performance in the second layer of some architectures.

Therefore, I will propose an architecture that slightly modifies the best-performing one, specifically by changing the activation of the first layer to `leaky_relu` (which performed well in other configurations) and the second layer's activation to `prelu` (which was used in the best performing model for the first layer).
