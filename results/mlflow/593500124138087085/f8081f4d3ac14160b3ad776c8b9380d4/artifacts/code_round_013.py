Analyzing the performance history, the top-performing architectures consistently utilize `GATConv` and `GCNConv`. Specifically, `GATConv` in the first layer with `leaky_relu` and 128 output channels, followed by `GCNConv` with `relu` and 64 output channels, and finally an `auto` output channel `GCNConv` seems to be a strong pattern. The best performance achieved is 0.7620 with `prelu` as the activation for the first layer.

Given the exploitation phase, I will try to slightly improve upon this by using `leaky_relu` for the first `GATConv` layer (which performed well in other top architectures) and keeping the subsequent layers similar. I'll also consider the hyperparameters. A higher epoch count (200) and a slightly higher learning rate (0.005) than the absolute best (0.7620 with 0.001 lr) might yield better results. Dropout of 0.5 was used in the best-performing model.

Therefore, the proposed architecture focuses on:
1.  **First Layer:** `GATConv` with `leaky_relu` and 128 channels.
2.  **Second Layer:** `GCNConv` with `relu` and 64 channels.
3.  **Third Layer:** `GCNConv` with `identity` activation and `auto` channels.
4.  **Hyperparameters:** `epochs=200`, `lr=0.005`, `dropout=0.5`.
