The performance history indicates that `GATConv` and `SAGEConv` tend to perform well, often appearing together in successful architectures. The best performing architecture used `GATConv` (128 channels, prelu), followed by `SAGEConv` (64 channels, relu), and finally `GCNConv` (auto channels, identity). This suggests a progression from more complex layers to simpler ones for the final classification.

Given the current round and the "Exploration" phase, it's beneficial to try variations that build upon these successful patterns while also exploring other options within the search space. We can experiment with different combinations of layer types and activations, and potentially adjust the channel sizes in the initial layers. Let's try a combination that features `GATConv` with `leaky_relu` as an alternative to `prelu`, and then follow with `SAGEConv` and `GCNConv`. We'll also explore a slightly different hyperparameter combination.
