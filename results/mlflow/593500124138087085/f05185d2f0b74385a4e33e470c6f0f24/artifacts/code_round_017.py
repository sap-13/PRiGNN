The previous successful architectures tend to use `GATConv` in the first layer with a `relu` or `leaky_relu` activation and an `out_channels` of 128. The second layer often uses `GCNConv` or `SAGEConv` with `64` output channels and a `relu` or `prelu` activation. The final layer is consistently a `GCNConv` with `auto` output channels and `identity` activation.

The best performing models have achieved a validation metric of 0.7620 and 0.7600. These models utilized `GCNConv` with `prelu` and `leaky_relu` respectively in the first layer followed by `GATConv` with `128` output channels and `relu` or `prelu` activation.

Given the "Exploitation" phase, I will aim to refine the most successful patterns. I will stick with `GATConv` as the first layer with 128 output channels, as this has been consistently good. For the activation in the first layer, `relu` seems to be slightly better than `leaky_relu` in the top performing models. For the second layer, `GCNConv` with `64` output channels and `prelu` activation has performed well. The final layer will remain `GCNConv` with `auto` output channels and `identity` activation.

For hyperparameters, the best performing models used `epochs` of 200, `lr` of 0.005, and `dropout` of 0.6. I will select these as they appear to be the optimal settings based on the history.
