Analyzing the performance history, we see that `SAGEConv` and `GATConv` as the first two layers have generally performed well, with `SAGEConv` followed by `GATConv` being the best performing configuration so far (0.7720). The `relu` and `prelu` activations have been prevalent in successful models. The `out_channels` of 64 and 128 have also yielded good results in the initial layers. The final layer is consistently `GCNConv` with `identity` activation and `auto` out_channels.

Given the current round (9 of 20) and the "Exploitation" phase, the strategy is to refine successful patterns. The top performing architecture used `SAGEConv` with `prelu` (64 channels) followed by `GATConv` with `relu` (32 channels). Let's try to build upon this by:

1.  **Slightly modifying the first layer:** Keep `SAGEConv` but experiment with `relu` activation, as it has also performed well. Increase `out_channels` to 128, as this has also been seen in successful configurations.
2.  **Improving the second layer:** Keep `GATConv` but increase `out_channels` to 64, aiming for potentially richer representations. Use `leaky_relu` which also showed good performance.
3.  **Keeping the third layer:** The `GCNConv` with `identity` activation and `auto` out_channels has been a consistent final layer, so we'll retain it.
4.  **Hyperparameters:** The best `lr` appears to be 0.005 or 0.001. Let's try `0.005`. For `epochs`, 200 has been used, so let's stick with that. For `dropout`, 0.5 is in the successful range.
