The previous best performing architecture used `GCNConv` followed by `GATConv`, with `prelu` and `relu` activations respectively, and a final `GCNConv` with `identity`. The `out_channels` were 64 and 128 for the first two layers. The current round is an exploration phase, so I will deviate from the previous best by introducing `SAGEConv` and trying a different activation function. I will also experiment with the highest number of channels and a different activation for the initial layers.
