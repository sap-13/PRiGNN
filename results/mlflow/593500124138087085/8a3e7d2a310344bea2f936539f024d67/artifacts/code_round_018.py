The performance history shows that architectures with a `GATConv` as the first layer, followed by `GCNConv` and then `GCNConv` with `auto` channels, have generally performed well. Specifically, using `128` output channels for the first `GATConv` and `64` for the second layer (whether `GATConv` or `SAGEConv`) seems to be a good starting point. The activation functions `prelu` and `leaky_relu` for the first layer and `relu` for the second layer have also shown good results.

Considering the exploitation phase and the goal of incremental improvement, I will build upon the top-performing architectures. The top-performing architecture used `GCNConv` (64, prelu) -> `GATConv` (128, relu) -> `GCNConv` (auto, identity).

Let's try a slight variation that combines elements from the best performers. We can try `GATConv` (128, prelu) as the first layer, which has performed well in several top architectures, followed by `GCNConv` (64, leaky_relu), and then `GCNConv` with `auto` channels. We will also stick to parameters that have yielded good results, such as `epochs: 200`, `lr: 0.005`, and `dropout: 0.6`.
