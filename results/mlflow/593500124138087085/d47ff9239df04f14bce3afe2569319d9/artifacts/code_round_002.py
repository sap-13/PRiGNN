Given the task context (node classification on Cora), the provided search space, and the performance history, the strategic guidance is to **explore** diverse architectures in round 2 of 20. The past performance shows that `GATConv` and `SAGEConv` with `prelu` activation in the first layer achieved a validation metric of 0.7560, which is a good starting point.

To explore diversity, I will consider the following:

*   **Layer Types:** While GATConv and SAGEConv performed well, I will try a combination that includes GCNConv in the earlier layers to see how it fares.
*   **Activations:** The best performing model used `prelu` in the first layer. I will stick with that for the first layer and explore other options for subsequent layers as allowed.
*   **Out Channels:** I will try a different configuration for the initial layer, perhaps with fewer channels to see if it can still achieve good performance or to find a more efficient configuration. For the last layer, "auto" is generally a safe bet.
*   **Hyperparameters:** I will explore different `lr` and `dropout` values to see if they can improve upon the previous best.

Considering these points, I'll propose the following architecture:

*   **First Layer:** `GCNConv` with `relu` activation and `64` out channels. This introduces a different convolutional operator and activation than the best previous model.
*   **Second Layer:** `GATConv` with `prelu` activation and `128` out channels. This incorporates the best activation from the previous run and a higher channel count.
*   **Third Layer:** `SAGEConv` with `identity` activation and `auto` out channels. This brings in SAGEConv and the identity activation for the final output layer.
*   **Hyperparameters:** I'll explore a lower `lr` (0.005) and a higher `dropout` (0.6) to see if that helps generalization and performance.
