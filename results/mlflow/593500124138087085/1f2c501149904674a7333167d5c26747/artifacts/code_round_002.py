The previous best performing architecture used a GATConv, followed by a SAGEConv, and finally a GCNConv with 'auto' output channels and 'leaky_relu' activation in the first layer. The second best architecture had a GCNConv, then a GATConv, and a SAGEConv with 'relu' activations. Both architectures performed reasonably well, indicating that a combination of different GNN layers is beneficial.

Given we are in the exploration phase and it's only round 2, we should explore a different combination of layers and hyperparameters. Let's try a different ordering and leverage the `GATConv` again as it showed good results. We will try `prelu` activation for the first layer and a different channel size. For the second layer, we'll use `GCNConv` with `relu` activation and `128` channels. The final layer will be `SAGEConv` with `identity` activation.

For hyperparameters, let's explore a higher dropout rate of `0.6` and a learning rate of `0.005` with `100` epochs. This combination is distinct from the previous ones.
