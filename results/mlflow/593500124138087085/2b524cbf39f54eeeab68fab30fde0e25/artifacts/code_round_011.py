The performance history reveals that architectures incorporating `GATConv` with `128` output channels and `prelu` activation in the first layer have performed well, achieving the highest validation metric of `0.7560`. The second layer seems to benefit from `SAGEConv` with `64` output channels and either `relu` or `prelu` activation. The final layer consistently uses `GCNConv` with `identity` activation for the `auto` output channels.

Given the "Exploitation" phase and round 11, I will build upon this successful pattern. I'll try to slightly refine the second layer by keeping `SAGEConv` with `64` channels but will switch the activation to `prelu` as it appeared in the best performing architecture. For hyperparameters, I will stick with the higher `epochs` of 200 and a `dropout` of 0.5, as this combination is present in the top-performing architecture. For `lr`, I'll experiment with `0.005` as it's in the best performing model.
