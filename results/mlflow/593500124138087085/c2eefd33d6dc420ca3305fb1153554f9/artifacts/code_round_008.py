The performance history suggests that architectures with a mix of GNN layers, particularly `SAGEConv` and `GATConv`, tend to perform well. The best performing architectures have achieved around 0.77. The `GCNConv` as the final layer with `identity` activation is a consistent pattern for the last layer.

Looking at the best performing architectures:
- The top two architectures use `SAGEConv` (with `prelu`) and `GATConv` (with `relu` or `leaky_relu`) in the first two layers, followed by `GCNConv` with `identity`.
- The `out_channels` for the initial layers are either 64 or 128.

Given we are in the exploitation phase and aiming to improve on 0.7720, we should focus on combinations that have worked.

Let's consider the following:
- **First layer:** `SAGEConv` with `prelu` and 64 channels performed best. Let's stick with this or explore a slight variation. `GATConv` with 64 channels and `leaky_relu` also performed reasonably well.
- **Second layer:** The best two used `GATConv` with 32 channels and `relu`, and `GATConv` with 64 channels and `leaky_relu`. Let's try `GATConv` with 64 channels and `relu` as a slight variation from the top performer.
- **Third layer:** `GCNConv` with `identity` activation and `auto` channels is a consistent successful pattern.

For hyperparameters, the best validation scores were achieved with `lr` of 0.01 and 0.005, and epochs of 200. Dropout values of 0.5 and 0.6 have been used.

Based on this, I propose the following architecture:

- **Layer 1:** `SAGEConv` with `prelu` and 64 channels (inspired by the best performer).
- **Layer 2:** `GATConv` with `relu` and 64 channels (a slight variation on the best performing 32 channels).
- **Layer 3:** `GCNConv` with `identity` activation and `auto` channels (consistent final layer).
- **Hyperparameters:** `epochs`: 200, `lr`: 0.005, `dropout`: 0.5 (a balanced choice from the better performing values).
