Given the task context, search space, performance history, and strategic guidance, my goal is to propose a novel and promising GNN architecture for the Cora node classification task. I am in the exploration phase (round 1 of 20), so I should aim to explore diverse options.

The past performance shows a validation metric of 0.7280 with a specific architecture:
- Layer 1: GATConv with 64 out_channels and leaky_relu activation.
- Layer 2: SAGEConv with 32 out_channels and relu activation.
- Layer 3: GCNConv with "auto" out_channels and identity activation.

This suggests that a combination of GATConv and SAGEConv can be effective. However, to explore further, I will try a different sequence and potentially different layer types and hyperparameters.

Here's my reasoning for the proposed architecture:

1.  **Layer 1: GATConv with higher channels and PReLU:** The previous best used GATConv. I'll stick with GATConv but increase the `out_channels` to 128 to potentially capture more complex relationships. PReLU is a good alternative to leaky_relu and offers more flexibility.
2.  **Layer 2: SAGEConv with lower channels and ReLU:** Following the previous success of SAGEConv, I'll include it. Reducing the channels to 64 might help in distilling features after the initial wider GAT layer. ReLU is a standard and effective activation.
3.  **Layer 3: GCNConv with "auto" channels and identity activation:** The previous model used GCNConv as the final layer, which is a common practice for aggregation. Keeping "auto" for the output channels allows the AutoML system to determine the optimal dimensionality, and "identity" activation is appropriate for the final classification layer before the linear projection.

For hyperparameters:
-   **dropout:** I will increase dropout to 0.6 to further regularize the model, as the previous model did not specify dropout.
-   **epochs:** I will stick with 200 epochs, as this allows for sufficient training.
-   **lr:** I will try a lower learning rate of 0.001 to potentially find a more stable and accurate minimum.

This combination aims to explore a different sequence of GNN layers and hyperparameter settings while building upon the insights from the previous attempt.
