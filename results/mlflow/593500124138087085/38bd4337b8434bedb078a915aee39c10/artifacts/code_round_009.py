Analyzing the performance history, the top-performing architectures share several characteristics:

*   **First Layer:** `GATConv` with `128` output channels and either `leaky_relu` or `relu` activation. The `GATConv` appears to be a strong performer for the initial layer.
*   **Second Layer:** `GCNConv` or `SAGEConv` with `64` output channels and `relu` activation.
*   **Third Layer:** Always `GCNConv` with `auto` output channels and `identity` activation. This is a consistent pattern for the final layer.
*   **Activations:** `relu`, `leaky_relu`, and `prelu` have all been used successfully in earlier layers. `identity` is preferred for the final layer.
*   **Output Channels:** Higher `out_channels` in the initial layers (128) seem to be beneficial.

Given the exploitation phase guidance, I will aim to refine the most successful patterns. The best performing architecture used `GCNConv` (64, prelu) -> `GATConv` (128, relu) -> `GCNConv` (auto, identity). Another good performer used `GATConv` (128, leaky_relu) -> `SAGEConv` (64, relu) -> `GCNConv` (auto, identity).

I will try to combine elements of these successful strategies. I will stick with `GATConv` as the first layer, as it has performed very well. I will use `128` channels and `leaky_relu` as seen in a high-performing configuration. For the second layer, I'll use `GCNConv` with `64` channels and `relu`, which has also appeared in good architectures. The final layer will remain `GCNConv` with `auto` channels and `identity` activation.

For hyperparameters, the best performing architectures have often used `epochs: 200`, `lr: 0.005`, and `dropout: 0.5` or `0.6`. I will lean towards `epochs: 200`, `lr: 0.005` and a `dropout` of `0.5` to slightly differentiate from the absolute best but stay within the promising range.
