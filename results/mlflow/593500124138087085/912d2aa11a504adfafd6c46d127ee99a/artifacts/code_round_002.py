The task is node classification on the Cora dataset. The search space includes GCNConv, GATConv, and SAGEConv layers with different activations and output channel sizes. The performance history shows that a SAGEConv layer followed by GATConv and GCNConv achieved a validation metric of 0.7120. This is the first round of exploration, so the goal is to try a diverse architecture.

Considering the previous best performing architecture utilized SAGEConv as the first layer, and GATConv for the second, and given that the exploration phase encourages trying novel combinations, I will deviate from the previous successful pattern to explore a different layer type as the initial layer. GATConv has shown good performance in graph tasks due to its ability to learn feature importance. For the second layer, using a SAGEConv might capture local neighborhood information effectively. For the final output layer, GCNConv is a standard choice.

Regarding the hyperparameters, the previous runs suggest that `prelu` and `relu` activations performed better than `leaky_relu` in the initial layers. The current phase encourages exploration, so I will try a different set of hyperparameters. I'll keep the `epochs` at 200 and try a lower `lr` of 0.001 for potentially finer convergence, and a `dropout` of 0.5 for moderate regularization.
